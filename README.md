# SecureBand


All content show on the page apart from the nav bar is in the database. I dont have a admin account who can remove/add content. This is what I want, a admin account that is. My site is already really secure. All account made on my website are secured with a hashed password. But I don't have a verification mail. This is what i would also like to add to my website to make it extra secure.
